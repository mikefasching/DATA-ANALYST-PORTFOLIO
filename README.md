In this portfolio, I will include a variety of projects that will showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. These projects will demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.

I will also include my work in programming languages such as Python, SQL and R. These projects will showcase my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.

In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.
